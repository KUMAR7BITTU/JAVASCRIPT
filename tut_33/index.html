<!-- 
Notes on DOM collections :-

1, They are read only .
2, They are live .
 element.childNodes variable(reference) will automatically update if childNodes of element is changed .
3, They are iterable using for of loop .-->

<!--

n Chrome DevTools, $0, $1, $2, $3, and $4 are special variables that store the most recently inspected DOM elements.

Here’s how they work:

How $0, $1, … $4 Work

When you inspect an element in DevTools (using the Elements panel):

$0 = the currently selected element

$1 = the previously selected element

$2 = the one before that

… up to $4

So:

✔ When you inspect an element:

It becomes $0

The old $0 becomes $1

The old $1 becomes $2

and so on…

Example

Inspect <h1>
→ now $0 === <h1>

Inspect <p>
→ now $0 === <p>
→ $1 === <h1>

Inspect <a>
→ $0 === <a>
→ $1 === <p>
→ $2 === <h1>

Relation between $0 and $1

They are not physically related in the DOM — they just represent your history of inspected elements.

$0 = most recent selection

$1 = previous selection

$2 = older selection

It’s simply DevTools keeping track of what you selected earlier.

<!-- 
Siblings and the parent ;-

Siblings are nodes that are children o the same parent .
-->

<!-- 
1, For example :- <head> and <body> are siblings . Sibling have same parent . In this above example it's html .
    
2, <body> is said to be the "next" or "right" sibling of <head> . 
    
<head> is said to be the "previous" or "left" sibling of <body> .

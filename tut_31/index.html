<!-- Walking the DOM -->
 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>myapp9</title>
</head>

<script>
 console.log(document.body)
</script>
<!-- Note :- document.body can sometimes be null if the javascript is written before the body tag . -->

<body>
    Hello World <span>This is span</div> 
    <!-- Here div will automatically corrected by the browser and it will be changed to span . -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

<!-- DOM tree refers to the HTML page where all the nodes are objects. 
 
There can be 3 main types of nodes in the DOM tree :-

1, text nodes
2, element nodes
3, comment nodes

In an HTML page, <html> is at the root and <head> & <body> are it's children, etc .

A text node is always a leaf of the tree .

Auto Correction :- If an errorneous HTML is encountered by the browser, it tends to correct it . For example , if we put something after the body, it is automatically moved inside the body . Another example is <table> tag which must contain <tbody> .

<!-- 
 
Children of an element :- Direct as well as deeply nested elements of an element are called it's children .

Child nodes :- Elements that are direct children . for example head & body are children of <html> .

sibling nodes :- head & body are sibling of <html> .

Descendant nodes :- All nested elements, children, their children and so on ....

-->

<!-- 

firstChild, lastChild & childNodes

element.firstChild -> first child element 
element.lastChild -> last child element 
element.childNodes -> All child nodes 


following is always true :- 
element.childNodes[0] === element.firstChild
element.childNodes[element.childNodes.length - 1] === element.lastChild

There is also a method element.hasChildNodes() to check whether there are any child nodes .

Note :- childNodes look like an array , but it's not actually an array, but a collection. Therefore we can't use array methods in node list or HTML collections. We can use Array.from(collection) to convert it into an Array .

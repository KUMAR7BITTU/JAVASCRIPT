<!-- Benefit of seperate script files using src attribute of script tag :-

1, Browser caching .
2, Separation of concern .

Browser caching :- for suppose we have created three script.js file for different - different actions or tasks, we have not done any changes on it so when we will load that browser , then all these script.js will be already stored in cache and will be loaded from there . Browser will not download it and load it again .

Separation of concern :- We can create different script.js file for different-different action , so that different individuals can perform there task separately . -->
